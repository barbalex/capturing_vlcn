    <h1>Offline Maps</h1>

    <p>
      Offline mapping capabilities of erfassen.app depend on the following map
      and data types.

    </p>

    <h3>1. Data captured in erfassen.app</h3>

    <p>
      Data (geographical or not) you captured on a certain device remains
      locally available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data captured by someone else, or you on a different device, is synced to
      your device automatically and immediately, whenever the app is active and
      internet available.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can always capture new data (geographical or not), irrespective of
      internet availability.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may wish to display some of the following types of maps to help you
      with capturing geographic data, though:
    </p>

    <h3>2. Vector maps</h3>

    <p>
      Similar to data captured in erfassen.app, vector maps are always
      downloaded to your device and thus locally available.
    </p>

    <h3>3. WMTS maps (Web Map Tiling Service)</h3>
    <p>
      WMTS maps are image based. Images can be huge. Multiple images are needed
      for the same area, to account for different zoom levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also: WMTS servers will usually fail when requested to deliver very large
      amounts of data. Their failure-threshold can vary, making automated
      pre-downloading hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, unlike vector maps, image maps are not automatically downloaded to
      your device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, you can explicitly choose areas to be downloaded (in the image
      maps form) before going offline.
    </p>

    <h3>4. WMS maps (Web Map Service)</h3>

    <p>
      WMS servers do not provide tiles. Instead, they provide a single image
      tailored for the exact extent and zoom level currently used in your map.
    </p>
    <p>This makes pre-downloading for offline usage much harder.</p>
    <p>
      Currently WMS maps can not be used offline in erfassen.app. Please tell us
      if you need this feature and why.

    <p>
      Web map servers use different technologies to deliver maps. The following
      are most common:
    </p>

    <h3>1. WMS: Web Map Service</h3>
    <p>
      WMS is an{' '}
      <a
        href="https://www.ogc.org/standards/wms"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer"
      >
        official standard
      </a>
      , defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium.
    </p>
    <p>A WMS server returns a single map image for the requested region.</p>

    <h3>2. WMTS: Web Map Tiling Service</h3>
    <p>
      WMS is an{' '}
      <a
        href="https://www.ogc.org/standards/wmts"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noreferrer"
      >
        official standard
      </a>
      , defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium.
    </p>
    <p>
      A WMTS-Server returns multiple (image-)tiles for the requested region and
      depending on the map zoom.
    </p>
    <p>This is advantageous in certain situations. For instance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When a map is panned. Only the missing tiles need to be fetched</li>
      <li>
        Tiles can be cached and reloaded offline much better than WMS images
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. TMS: Tiled Map Service</h3>
    <p>
      TMS is not an official standard. It existed before WMTS and may still be
      used by some map servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      TMS is similar to WMTS in that it returns (image-)tiles for the requested
      region.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike WMTS it can not query capabilites, legends or feature-info. Thus
      configuring a TMS-Layer can not be automated.
    </p>
    <p>
      TMS is not implemented in erfassen but could be added. Please tell us if
      you need it.

    <h1>Data Synchronisation</h1>
    <h3>1. Goal</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Every user</li>
      <li>has access to all the data</li>
      <li>he/she may access</li>
      <li>on every device</li>
      <li>irrelevant of internet availability</li>
      <li>with minimal fuss.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>

    <h3>2. What is synchronized</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        User data: All data input by users, owned by the account owner. Can be
        divided into:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Configuration data: Project(s), tables, fields and maps configuration.
          Managed by the project&apos;s manager(s)
        </li>
        <li>
          Core user data: table rows and related files. The actual data captured
          by most collaborators
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Vector maps</li>
      <li>WMTS maps</li>
      <li>WMS maps</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. When things are synchronized</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Core user data is constantly synced two ways (app &lt;&gt; server) while
        the app is active and internet is available.
        <br />
        This enables concurrent data capturing by multiple users while keeping
        data conflicts at a minimum as every user immediately sees other
        user&apos;s inputs
      </li>
      <li>
        Configuration data is synced two ways on app start.
        <br />
        This includes configuration for vector, WMTS and WMS maps
      </li>
      <li>
        Vector data: If it was uploaded to erfassen.app, it is directly
        downloaded.
        <br />
        If it originates from a WFS service, the app fetches it from the WFS
        service (if necessary)
      </li>
      <li>
        WMTS image data: TODO: Image data is (not) automatically fetched from
        the WMTS service?
      </li>
      <li>
        WMS maps are (currently){' '}
        <Link to="/docs/offline-maps">only available online</Link>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. How things are synchronized</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Data managed by the project&apos;s manager(s) is simply downloaded,
        overwriting the local version, if the server-side version is newer than
        the local version:
        <ul>
          <li>Configuration data</li>
          <li>Uploaded vector data</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Data originating from web services is fetched from those:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>WFS vector data</li>
        <li>TODO: WMTS image data in areas marked for download?</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Core user data <Link to="/docs/data-versioning">is versioned</Link> to
        enable dealing with conflicts
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Edits are queued</h3>
    <p>
      Edits are sent into a queue. When online they are immediately sent to the
      server. When offline they are persisted and sent to the server, as soon as
      internet is available.
